# My Engine
This is a first prototipe made of the engine designed for the first Asigment recuired. Link: https://github.com/MeriAlguero/Engine 
## ImGui
The engine uses the free library ImGui to showcase some options in the screen, like showing gizmos or the FPS.
## Camera System
To make navigation intuitive, the camera uses the following shortcuts:

* **Movement:** Use `W` `A` `S` `D` to pan through the screen.
* **Zoom:** Use the `Mouse Wheel` to zoom in and out.
* **Panning** Use the `Left Mouse Click` to move the camera around the scene.
* **Focus** Use `F`to focus on the object in the screen.

### Why this camera?
This engine is designed to have similarities with **Unity** HUD, this way making it more universal.

#### Additional Comments
F0r some reason the Quad doesn't want to appear.
